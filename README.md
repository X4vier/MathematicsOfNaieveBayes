# Mathematics of Naive Bayes 
---

This is a project I completed as part of a statistical machine learning course at ANU in April 2017.

This project serves to demonstrate my high degree of competence with statistics/probability theory. There were also programing components of this assignment, but they were not especially challenging. In this the project I was asked to implement a Naive Bayes classifier from scratch (not using existing libraries other than numpy), by mathematically deriving the Maximum-Likelihood and Maximum-A-Posteriori estimators.

All releveant work is found in the jupyter notebook `naive_bayes.ipynb`

The course instructor provided students with a template notebook to start from. Everything inside the notebook beneath a  blue heading is my own work.
